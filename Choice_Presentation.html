						<FONT SIZE=7>What is its purpose?</FONT>
						<p>This app helps users stay current on the state of the pandemic with daily metrics on vaccine distribution, coronavirus case counts by state and county, plus how the government is spending to boost the economy.</p>

							
								
							
						<FONT SIZE=7>How was the data collected?</FONT>
							<p>This interactive feature aggregates data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state- and local-level public health agencies. County-level data is confirmed by referencing state and local agencies directly. Cases, deaths, and per capita adjustments reflect cumulative totals since January 22, 2020.</p>
							<p>For most states, USAFacts directly collects the daily county-level cumulative totals of positive cases and deaths from a table, dashboard, or PDF on the state public health website. This data is compiled either through scraping or manual entry.</p>
							<p>Because of the frequency with which we are currently updating this data, they may not reflect the exact numbers reported state and local government organizations or the news media. Numbers may also fluctuate as agencies update their own data.</p>
							
							<FONT SIZE=5>Unique states</FONT>
							<p>California and Texas state public health websites do not currently offer accurate county-level statistics. Instead, USAFacts individually pulls the most current numbers from each county’s public health website (58 counties for California and 254 counties for Texas).</p>
							<p>Rhode Island’s public health website reports by town rather than the county, and we currently roll this up into counties. Rhode Island also doesn't report towns or counties with respect to its deaths, however, the state does periodically provide data on deaths in nursing homes, providing the location for those.</p>
							<p>The Kansas state public health agency updates its data on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The case and death counts for Kansas counties are compiled by consulting both the state data and county public health agency data, where available. If the two sources are not reporting the same values, the higher value is recorded.</p>
							<p>Utah’s state government groups 22 of the state's 29 counties into one of six regional health agencies. Data for these individual counties is compiled from the six regional agencies.</p>
							<p>Idaho's state health agency does not update its data on Sundays.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							<p></p>
							
							<FONT SIZE=5>Cases not attributed to specific counties</FONT>
							<p>The 21 cases confirmed on the Grand Princess cruise ship on March 5 and 6 are attributed to the state of California, but not to any counties.</p>
							<p>Some cases counted at the state level are not allocated to counties due to lack of information.</p>
							
							<FONT SIZE=5>Counting cases and deaths</FONT>
							<p>USAFacts currently counts presumptive positive cases as confirmed cases, as this is in line with how the CDC reports data. USAFacts assign cases to where the person was diagnosed as that information becomes available.</p>
							<p>USAFacts takes deaths directly from state and local agencies. Per official CDC reporting guidelines, deaths should only be counted as COVID-19-related if the disease played a significant role in causing death. If a state reports both the location of death and the location of residency, we attribute the death to the location of residency.</p>
							
							<FONT SIZE=5>Timing</FONT>
							<p>USAFacts mostly collect data in the evening (Pacific Time). USAFacts generally update the data on their website by 9am PST.</p>
							
						<FONT SIZE=7>Who are the users that this visualization was made for?</FONT>
							<p>The visualization was mainly made for U.S. residents who seek to follow the state of the pandemic with daily metrics on vaccine distribution, coronavirus case counts by state and county and how the government responds</p>
							
						
						<FONT SIZE=4>Plants in Illinois</FONT>
						<p>In this page, is shows a properly centered and scaled leaflet map of Illinois showing the plant data in 2018. Power plants are colored by type. </p>
						<p>For input control, There are sets of check boxes, one for each energy source, plus 'all' (where all is the default selection), renewables, and non-renewables, allowing the user to filter which energy sources are shown on the map. Besides, a reset button is offered to go back to the original view.</p>
						
						<a href="#" class="image full"><img src="images/pj2_Plants in Illinois.png" alt="Plants in Illinois.png" ></a>
						<br>
						
						<FONT SIZE=4>Split screen visualization</FONT>
						<p>On the basis of the previous page, some functions have been expanded. </p>
						<p>
							<li>Split screen:</li>
							This page split two parts allowing users to compare the plants status in different year and different state.
							<li>3 different layers:</li>
							It also allow the user to choose from 3 different useful leaflet map types—OSM, OpenTopoMap, Toner lite.
							<li>Popup function:</li>
							clicking on a marker shows the plant name, and its generation capacity (for the different types it has), the percent of the total capacity that is renewable, and the percent of the total capacity that is non-renewable

						<FONT SIZE=4>Plants in the US</FONT>
						<p>Compared with the above two pages, this page has more new features. </p>
						<p>
							<li>Entire US:</li>
							In addition to each of the 50 states the user would be able to pick the entire US.
							<li>Slider function:</li>
							The user could filter the showing plants by generation amount.
							<li>Cluster:</li>
							This one shows a lot of markers, so I added the cluster option to make it faster. When many markers are concentrated, cluster will be displayed

						<br>
						
						<FONT SIZE=4>Plants added or idled</FONT>
						<p>
							This page shows the plants added or idled in 2010 and 2018 by Cross compare data in 2000, 2010 and 2018. Idled plants and added plants are divided into two groups. The user could use the checkbox in the map to select which group to show.

						<br>
							<FONT SIZE=7>Data</FONT>
							<p>The original data is available from <a href="https://www.epa.gov/egrid/download-data">Environmental Protection Agency(EPA)</a>.<br>
							Mainly, we focus on </p>
								<li>eGRID2018v2 Data File (XLSX)</li>
									<p>For the first data file, we only look at data from the PLNT18 sheet. This sheet contains data from all plants in 2018 for all 50 US states.</p>
								<li>eGRID historical files (1996-2016) (ZIP)</li>
									<p>For the compressed file, we only look at EGRDPLNT00 in eGRID2000_plant.xls PLNT10 in eGRID2010_Data.xls. These sheets contain data from all plants for all 50 US states in 2000 and 2010 respectively.</p>
					<img src="images/pj2_download.png" alt="Download page in EPA" width="565" height="689">
					<p></p>
							<p>Next, I make some changes to the data files before loading them into R to shrink the size of the data files and improve efficiency.<br>
								The strategy is to keep only the columns that will be used in this project.</p>
							<p>For PLNT18 in egrid2018_data_v2.xlsx:<br>

							<FONT SIZE=7>Interesting things I found</FONT>
							<br>
								<FONT SIZE=4>1 Renewable energy plants in 2000, 2010 and 2018</FONT>
									<p>I use the third visualization to see the renewable sources in the entire US. Compare difference between 2000, 2010, 2018. We can easily see the trend that the number of renewable energy plants has been rising.</p>
									
						<img src="images/pj2_i1_2000.png" alt="" width="720" height="406"/><br>
						<img src="images/pj2_i1_2010.png" alt="" width="720" height="406"/><br>
						<img src="images/pj2_i1_2018.png" alt="" width="720" height="406"/>
						<br>
						<FONT SIZE=4>2 Non-renewable energy plants in 2000, 2010 and 2018</FONT>
						<p>
							Next, let’s see the variation of non-renewable energy plants across 2000, 2010, 2018.<br>
							Variation in the total amount of non-renewable energy plants is relatively small.<br>
							2429 (2000)-> 2637 (2010)-> 2579 (2018)
