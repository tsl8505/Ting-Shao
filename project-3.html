							<FONT SIZE=7>Introduction</FONT>
								<p>This project will focus on using R to visualize data on electrical power usage in Chicago in 2010, and use shiny to give people an interactive interface to create those visualizations.</p>
								<p>Here we are going to look at data on electricity and gas usage by census block in the city of Chicago to see how neighborhoods, types of buildings, age of buildings can affect how much power is used throughout the year. This project can also serve as a model for looking at other kinds of census data related to the Chicago (or other areas of the US).</p>
								<p>Different from project 2, we use Mapview, which is one of the most popular open-source libraries for interactive maps, to visualize the data. </p>
								
								
							
							
						<FONT SIZE=7>How to run this application</FONT>
						<p>There are three sections for this app —- Near West Side, Split screen visualization, Entire city of Chicago at the tract level.</p>
						
						
						<FONT SIZE=4>Near West Side</FONT>
						<p>In this page, it shows a properly centered and scaled mapview map of the Near West Side Community Area.</p>
						<p>For input control, There are three select inputs and one reset button. <br>
							The first one allows the user to choose to see Gas or Electricity or Building Age or Building Type or Building Height or Total Population.<br>
							The second one allows the user to filter out one particular kind of building type or to see all building types.<br>
							If the first input is choosed to be Gas or Electricity, the user will then pick a particular month or the total for the entire year to display.<br>
							The reset button allows the user to return all parameters to the default settings.</p>
						<p>When the parameters are set, the display is divided into three parts -- Mapview, Graph, Table</p>
						
						<p>
							<li>Mapview:</li>
							Mapview map of the Near West Side Community Area.<br>
							By default it should show the total electrical usage over the entire year as a heatmap.<br>
							And it adjust the attribute to be rendered of the heat map according to the user's selection on the display input.<br>
							<img src="images/pj3_NWS_mapview.png" alt="pj3_NWS_mapview.png" width="864" height="540">
							<li>Graph:</li>
							This part shows two bar charts showing the total amount of electricity and gas used in the current census blocks being shown for each month of the year.<br>
							<img src="images/pj3_NWS_graph.png" alt="pj3_NWS_graph.png" wwidth="864" height="540">
							<li>Table:</li>
							This part shows that same electricity and gas data as tables.<br>
							<img src="images/pj3_NWS_table.png" alt="pj3_NWS_table.png" width="864" height="540" >
						
						</p>

						<br>
						
						<FONT SIZE=4>Split screen visualization</FONT>
						<p>We split the screen in two allowing users to compare the data in different community area. By default the left should show the Near West Side and the right should show the Loop with appropriately scaled and zoomed maps.</p>
						<p>The display on both sides is based on the previous section.</p>
						<img src="images/pj3_entrie_tract.png" alt="pj3_entrie_tract" width="864" height="540" >
						<br>
						
	
						<FONT SIZE=4>Entire city of Chicago at the tract level</FONT>
						<p>Compared with the above two pages, in this section, we integrate the data from the census blocks into census tracts and allow the user to show the same data as above at the tract level for the entire City of Chicago.  </p>
						<img src="images/pj3_entire_10.png" alt="pj3_entire_10.png" width="864" height="540" >
						<p>The other new feature is that there is one tab allowing the user to show the 10% census tracts within the entire city with the:
							<li>oldest buildings</li>
							<li>newest building</li>
							<li>tallest buildings</li>
							<li>blocks that use the most electricity over the year</li>
							<li>blocks that use the most gas over the year</li>
							<li>most population</li>
							<li>most occupied percentage</li>
							<li>highest percentage of renters</li>  
						</p>

						<FONT SIZE=7>Data</FONT>
							<p>
								<FONT SIZE=4>Source</FONT><br>
								The original data is available from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-energy-usage-2010">kaggle</a>.<br>

								and also available at <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Energy-Usage-2010/8yq3-m6wp">Chicago Data Portal</a>.<br>
							</p>
							<p>
								<FONT SIZE=4>Content</FONT><br>
								Displays several units of energy consumption for households, businesses, and industries in the City of Chicago during 2010. Electric The data was aggregated from ComEd and Peoples Natural Gas by Accenture. Electrical and gas usage data comprises 88 percent of Chicago's buildings in 2010. The electricity data comprises 68 percent of overall electrical usage in the city while gas data comprises 81 percent of all gas consumption in Chicago for 2010.<br>
								<br>
								Census blocks with less than 4 accounts is displayed at the Community Area without further geographic identifiers. This dataset also contains selected variables describing selected characteristics of the Census block population, physical housing, and occupancy.<br>
								
							</p>
							<p>
								In this project, I did not make changes to the data file before loading it into R.

							<FONT SIZE=7>Interesting things I found</FONT>
							<br>
								<FONT SIZE=4>1 Renewable energy plants in 2000, 2010 and 2018</FONT>
									<p>I use the third visualization to see the renewable sources in the entire US. Compare difference between 2000, 2010, 2018. We can easily see the trend that the number of renewable energy plants has been rising.</p>

						<img src="images/pj2_i1_2010.png" alt="" width="720" height="406"/><br>
						<img src="images/pj2_i1_2018.png" alt="" width="720" height="406"/>
						<br>
						<FONT SIZE=4>2 Non-renewable energy plants in 2000, 2010 and 2018</FONT>
						<p>
							Next, let’s see the variation of non-renewable energy plants across 2000, 2010, 2018.<br>
							Variation in the total amount of non-renewable energy plants is relatively small.<br>
							2429 (2000)-> 2637 (2010)-> 2579 (2018)
